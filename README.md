#Snake AI - Purdue SIGAI
This is Purdue SIGAI's implementation of a Snake AI. This is our Fall 2015 project.

##To get this onto your computer
```
cd sigai
git clone https://github.com/PurdueSIGAI/Snake.git
cd Snake/js
```

##Current Errors
Currently only works on certain sizes of grids. If you're having trouble running the master version at a lab computer, open it in chrome and have it fill up half the screen. If you want the debugger open, have he widnow take up the full screen, with the dubugger taking up half and the snake grid on the other half.

##TODO
###AI
1. Use the snake body information to take into account if the head of the snake will get to a point before or after the tail will move past it
2. Get stacking function working properly
3. Continue work on deciding which of the above to do

###Engine
1. Remove key listeners
2. Make snake blocks surrounded by black, not blue
